## Overview

Applications grow in size and complexity and in a large organization there are many ways to reuse code to maintain consistency and to lower the development effort.

Developing in a modular way can be done using libraries, which are simply a collection of related files that perform a certain task. These are composed together to make up an application.

Libraries require classifiers to describe their contents and intended purpose. These classifiers help to organize the libraries and to provide a way to locate them.

### Scope

Scope relates to a logical grouping, business use-case, or domain contain libraries that manage a sub-domain of application logic.

### Type

Type relates to the contents of the library and indicates its purpose and usage. Examples of types are `data-access`, `feature`, `ui`, and `util`.

## Types of Libraries

### Feature Libraries

Developers should consider feature libraries as libraries that implement smart UI (with access to data sources) for specific business use cases or pages in an application.

### UI Libraries

A UI library contains only presentational components (also called "dumb" components).

### Data-Access Libraries

A data-access library contains code for interacting with a back-end system. It also includes all the code related to state management.

- `state` - for state files
- `application` - for facades
- `entities` - for interfaces, enums
- `infrastructure` - for services

### Utility Libraries

A utility library contains low-level utilities used by many libraries and applications.

## Installation

```shell
npm i -D @e-square/nx-ddd

## How To Customize the Library Generator

There are situations you need to customize the generated files more than what exists today.

It's very easy to customize existing generators with nx workspace generators.

This library exposed the generators to allow customization.

### Create Nx Workspace Generator

```shell
nx g workspace-generator shared-ui
```

### Update The Generator Implementation

```ts
import { formatFiles, readProjectConfiguration, Tree } from '@nrwl/devkit';

import {
  DDDLibraryFramework,
  dddLibraryGenerator,
  DDDLibraryType,
} from '@e-square/nx-ddd';

import { SharedUIScheme } from './scheme';

export default async (tree: Tree, { name }: SharedUIScheme): Promise<void> => {
  // Creates the library and return dddLibraryStructure object.
  const dddLibraryStructure = await dddLibraryGenerator(tree, {
    name,
    framework: DDDLibraryFramework.Angular,
    type: DDDLibraryType.UI,
    domain: 'shared',
    withoutTypePrefix: true,
    standaloneConfig: true,
  });

  // Let's read the project which was created.
  const projectConfiguration = readProjectConfiguration(
    tree,
    dddLibraryStructure.project
  );

  /**
   * Here you can use the projectConfiguration
   * For adding, deleting and updating files.
   */

  await formatFiles(tree);
};
```

### Run The Generator

```shell
nx workspace-generator shared-ui --name button
```
